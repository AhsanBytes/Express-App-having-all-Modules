        Nodemon will now watch for any changes in your files and automatically restart your Node.js application whenever you make modifications, saving you the effort of manually restarting the server after each change.

Make sure to include nodemon as a dev dependency in your project's package.json file if you plan to use Nodemon as part of your project's development workflow. This allows other developers working on your project to install Nodemon by running npm install without the -g flag.

Please note that to use Nodemon, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you haven't installed them yet, please do so before proceeding with Nodemon installation.
